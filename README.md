NLPModel -> Natural Language Processing model it can be a neural network, a parser, 

NLPModelBoW -> This is a NLPModel for Bag of Words with Artificial Neural Networks

NLPANN -> abstraction of Artificial Neural Networks to do NLP platform independent

NLPANNkeras -> An ANN in keras it is just a MLP it is used in NLPModelBoW

Intent -> ChatOS is based in chatbots type intention guessing

ChatBot -> A chatbot is a collection of intent and a model to guess intents

ChatBotEngine ->

## Chatget 
These are analogous to winget for GUI
## ChatDesktop
This is analogous to desktop GUI
## MetaChatBot
A chatbot to build or modify other chatbots
## ChatLearner
Detect prediction error an improve the model of chatbots
